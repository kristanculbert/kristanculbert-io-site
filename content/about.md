##About Me

I am a second-year master's student in the Bren School of Environmental Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My specializations at Bren are in Water Resources Management and Pollution Prevention and Remediation. 

I am a 2019-2020 [American Association of University Women Career Development Grantee](https://www.aauw.org/), which has funded both my work at UCSB and my time in Rajasthan, India as a Fellow in Duke University's [India Summer School for Future International Development Leaders](https://youtu.be/co1pHsz2QRs).
